Hey there! I am Adrian Palacios, a PhD student in Computer Science from [Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia) working on Programming Languages (mainly Erlang[^1]). In this blog, I intend to write about my research in a not-so-formal way, so that it can be spread to a larger group of people (not just scientists).

However, if you are interested in the formal aspects of my research, you can visit my [academic webpage](users.dsic.upv.es/~apalacios/), where I publish all the materials related to it.d HPSTR</a></div>
