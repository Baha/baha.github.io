Welcome to my blog! I am [Adrian]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about/index.html
%}), a PhD student from Valencia, Spain.

It has been a long time since I wanted to start this blog, and I have finally
found the time to set it up and write a few posts. I decided to begin working on
this blog after reading several times about the benefits of blogging for PhD
students. In summary, as a PhD student, blogging does allow you to:
* Practice and improve your writing skills.
* Disseminate your work.
* Talk about what you like from your research.
* Make your CV look nicer.

Given these, one could say that blogging should be mandatory if you care about
your research.

In this blog I intend to write mostly about the practical aspects of my
research, which are usually summarized or omitted in our papers. Here, I have
the chance to discuss with a larger audience and collect feedback from both the
professional and academic communities.

I hope that you enjoy my writing and the posts here are interesting to you. Do
not miss the chance to comment, even if it's just to say "hi"!
