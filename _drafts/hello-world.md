Welcome to my blog! I am [Adrian]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about/index.html %}), a PhD student from Valencia (Spain).

It has been a long time since I wanted to start this blog, and I have finally found the time to set it up and write the first two posts. I decided to begin working on this blog after reading several times about the benefits of blogging for PhD students. In summary, as a PhD student, blogging does allow you to:
* Practice and improve your writing skills.
* Disseminate your work.
* Talk about what you like from your research.
* Make your CV look nicer.

Given these, one could say that blogging should be mandatory if you care about your research.

In this blog I intend to write about the technical aspects of my research. That means I will write mostly about programming, but I will write a theoretical post from time to time (I think we already have enough of that in our papers).
